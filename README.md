# Crowdfunding ETL Project

---

## Project Description

The Crowdfunding ETL project focused on organizing and analyzing crowdfunding campaign data to provide a clear and structured view of various campaigns. The objective was to extract meaningful insights by efficiently processing raw data into a well-designed database structure that supports further analysis and reporting.

---

## Who Will Benefit and Why?

This project benefits data analysts, database administrators, and crowdfunding platform managers by offering a clean, organized dataset and database schema. With this structured data, stakeholders can better understand campaign trends, track performance metrics, and make informed decisions to improve crowdfunding strategies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset originates from edX Boot Camps LLC and is designed for educational use. It contains detailed information about crowdfunding campaigns, including categories, campaign details, contact information, and dates related to each campaign.

## How It Was Done

The project was executed in four key phases:

1. **Category and Subcategory Extraction:**
   The combined 'category & sub-category' field was split into distinct 'category' and 'subcategory' columns. Unique values were identified and saved into separate DataFrames (`category_df` and `subcategory_df`), which were then exported as CSV files.

2. **Campaign DataFrame Creation:**
   Campaign-related attributes such as company name, goal, pledged amount, outcome, backers, country, currency, launch, and deadline dates were organized. Category and subcategory IDs were linked to campaigns. Data types were converted, date columns formatted, and unnecessary columns removed. The resulting `campaign_df` was exported as a CSV file.

3. **Contacts DataFrame Creation:**
   Contact information stored as JSON was extracted, transformed into tabular format, and cleaned. The 'name' field was split into first and last names, with the final DataFrame (`contact_info_df`) reordered and exported as CSV.

4. **Database Schema and SQL Setup:**
   SQL scripts were written to create four tables — contacts, category, subcategory, and campaign — with appropriate primary and foreign key relationships. CSV data was loaded into corresponding tables, and a visual database schema was created using QuickDBD.

## Key Findings

* **How were categories organized?**
  The original combined category data was efficiently separated into distinct categories and subcategories, enabling easier filtering and analysis.

* **What was achieved with campaign data?**
  Campaign details were linked to unique category IDs, allowing cross-referencing between campaigns and their classifications.

* **How was contact data handled?**
  Complex JSON contact info was successfully transformed into clean, relational data with separate columns for first and last names.

* **What database structure was created?**
  A normalized relational database schema was designed, ensuring data integrity and relationships between contacts, campaigns, categories, and subcategories.

## Conclusion

This project successfully transformed raw crowdfunding data into a structured, relational database, facilitating easier access and analysis. The clean separation of categories, campaigns, and contacts improves data clarity and usability for downstream applications.

---

## Recommendations

Maintaining consistent data formats and expanding the schema to include additional campaign metrics or user interactions could further enhance insights. Integrating automated ETL pipelines would improve data freshness and scalability.
