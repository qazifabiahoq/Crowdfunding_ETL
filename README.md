# Crowdfunding ETL Project

## Project Overview
The Crowdfunding ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project aimed to analyze and organize crowdfunding data for a comprehensive understanding of various campaigns. The project was divided into four main parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of data handling and organization. Here's an overview of what was achieved in each part:

## Part 1: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
In this phase, the focus was on splitting the 'category & sub-category' column into separate 'category' and 'subcategory' columns. The unique categories and subcategories were identified, and two DataFrames, 'category_df' and 'subcategory_df', were created. These DataFrames were then exported as CSV files ('category.csv' and 'subcategory.csv').

## Part 2: Create the Campaign DataFrame
For campaign details, including company name, blurb, goal, pledged amount, outcome, backers count, country, currency, launch date, and deadline, the 'category' and 'subcategory' columns were linked to unique category and subcategory IDs. After data type conversion, column renaming, and formatting of date columns, the resulting DataFrame ('campaign_df') was merged with category and subcategory DataFrames. Unnecessary columns were dropped, and the final DataFrame was exported as a CSV file ('campaign.csv').

## Part 3: Create the Contacts DataFrame
This phase involved extracting information from the 'contact_info' column, initially in JSON format. The 'contact_info_df' DataFrame was created by converting this information into lists of values and assigning them to appropriate columns like 'contact_id', 'name', and 'email'. Additional data cleaning steps included splitting the 'name' column into 'first_name' and 'last_name'. The final DataFrame was reordered and exported as a CSV file ('contacts.csv').

## Part 4: Create the Crowdfunding Database
In this final step, SQL statements were crafted to define the structure of four tables: 'contacts', 'category', 'subcategory', and 'campaign'. Primary and foreign key constraints were set to establish relationships between these tables. The SQL script also included the creation of the 'contacts' and 'category' DataFrames from corresponding CSV files. A QuickDBD diagram visualizing the Crowdfunding Database schema was created and is available in the main branch.
